# 🏦 Configure profiler for organizations

While _profiler_ targets mainly user accounts, it's possible to render profiler for organization accounts.

![profiler (organization account)](https://github.com/nextlinux/profiler/blob/examples/profiler.organization.svg)

## *️⃣ Using *profiler\* on organization

Setup is mostly the same as for user accounts. A personal access token from an user account is required excepted that `read:org` scope must be enabled, **whether you are member of the target organization or not**.

`user` option will need to be set to organization name instead.

_Example: render profiler for `github` organization_

```yaml
- uses: nextlinux/profiler@latest
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PROFILER_TOKEN }}
    user: github
```

> 💡 If your organization using single sign-on, you may need to [authorize your personal token access](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on)

> 💡 Plugins supporting organizations account are labeled with `👥 Organizations`. Note that rendering consume way more API requests and huge organization may not actually be able to use a given plugin.

> 💡 To support private repositories, add `repo` scope

It is possible to host workflows in the `.github` repository of organizations, and display _profiler_ on [organization profiles](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile).

## \*️⃣ Organizations memberships for user accounts

By default, GitHub only display public memberships.
Membership visibility can be managed in the `People` tab of your organization.

> ⚠️ Seeing your organization membership in your profile **does not** mean that it is visible from other users! You can check this by viewing your profile in an private browser window.
